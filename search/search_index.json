It will give you the ability to wake your Alexa devices remotely to speak any text that you wish for almost any given scenario. There are now many different built-in automations that allow actions based on events in your home. Gone are the days of using expensive speakers connected to your hub. The day that you have all been waiting for has arrived.

The beauty is in the flexibility of each action, it can be as simple as a single speech event when the front door is unlocked. To as complex as selecting multiple triggers (contacts, motion, presence, etc.) and defining criteria and custom responses for each individual event type. Current Triggers Available: # Date/Time Events: Scheduled Time Sunrise/Sunset Location Events: Modes Routines Scenes (Hubitat) Safety & Security Events: Alarm (HSM/SHM) Fire/Smoke Carbon Monoxide Actionable Device Events: Locks Lock Codes Buttons Outlets/Switches Dimmers/Level Garage Door Openers Valves Window Shades Thermostats Sensor Device Events: Contacts | Doors | Windows Battery Level Motion Presence Illuminance Temperature Humidity Water Power Action Types Available # Speak (SSML Supported) Announcements/Broadcasts (SSML and Multi-Device Supported) Speak Tiered | Create a response that plays out in phases with unique delays between each response Announcements/Broadcasts | Create a response that plays out in phases with unique delays between each response SSML support for all Speak and Announcements Custom Sequences Weather Reports Playback/Volume Control Built-In Routine Functions: Sing a Song Flash Briefing Fun Fact Traffic Report Tell a Joke Tell a Story Say Goodbye Say Good Night!

Tap on Action Type . Select the desired Action Type. Move of to Step 2. Step 2: Configure Trigger Events # Tap on Action Triggers . Tap on Select Trigger Events Select your trigger types (Multiple Allowed) and press Done . You will be shown a config section for each trigger selected. Select the devices to subscribe to for the trigger type. Confuring the Changes to? option. Note: Selecting any* for the changes to input will prevent you from using the monitoring features. * If you selected any you will see these options: Otherwise you see: If you choose to configure the Only after options: Note: You can configure an additional repeat every (xx) seconds until the trigger value changes. When repeat after is configured you will see a new input for custom repeat response items. Note: Entering multiple responses in any of the triggers custom response will enable random response selection per event trigger type. Press Done/Save to return to main action config page Step 3: Configure Conditions/Restrictions # Note: Conditions are optional and just help fine tune when a action can execute. Note: Think of these conditions as the gate keeper. All conditions have to pass as a whole, meaning the more conditions the more strict your action will be to execute. Tap on Conditions/Restrictions . Configure any desired conditions. Press Done/Save to return to main action config page Step 4: Configure Action Execution # Tap on Execution Config in Step 4. This is where the desired Echo Devices are selected. Once the action type is selected you will see: Now select your echo devices to execute the action on. Note: The echo device list is populated based on device capability and the selected action type. You can now configure the remaining options. Note: The action type config options are different for each action type. So may see something different than the photo below. Note: When Speak and Announcement types are selected you will see a Global Action Text Response input. This can be confusing seeing as you may or may not have configured responses under the triggers. Think of the global response as the output for any and all triggers meaning no matter the trigger it will always use these responses even if responses are defined under triggers. But if you leave this blank it will either use the individual trigger responses or generate a generic response based on the event. Option: Volume Options may be shown based on the selected Action Type. Option: Delay Action allows you to delay the execution (xx) seconds. Once your all configured you can toggle the Test this Action? to simulate the action. NOTE: When no responses are defined the app will use all of the selected trigger types and values to randomly generate an event response to perform the test speech. Press Done/Save to return to the main action page. You can review the configuration descriptions and Press Next when ready. Now all that remains is to give the action a name. Press Done/Save to complete the creation of the new Action.","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"actions/config/actions_config/#action_config_options","text":"","title":"Action Config Options"},{"location":"actions/config/actions_config/#create_new_action","text":"","title":"Create New Action:"},{"location":"actions/config/actions_config/#step_1_configure_action_type","text":"","title":"Step 1: Configure Action Type"},{"location":"actions/config/actions_config/#step_2_configure_trigger_events","text":"","title":"Step 2: Configure Trigger Events"},{"location":"actions/config/actions_config/#step_3_configure_conditionsrestrictions","text":"","title":"Step 3: Configure Conditions/Restrictions"},{"location":"actions/config/actions_config/#step_4_configure_action_execution","text":"","title":"Step 4: Configure Action Execution"},{"location":"actions/examples/actions_examples/","text":"Example Actions # Contact Monitor Example: # This example subscribes to contact events.

Simply clear the log in information for the Heroku App and log back in to Amazon. This should fix your issue right away. Steps to Fix # Step 1: # Log into the https://dashboard.heroku.com website and click on your echo-speaks-xxxxxxx app. Step 2: # Then click on the Settings . Step 3: # Scroll down to the Domains and Certificates section (pictured below). Step 4: # Click on the link listed next to Domain . This will take you to the Amazon Cookie Retrieval page which looks similar to the picture below. If it shows 'Authentication Good` then you should then be good to go. If you are directed to log in again, then just do it and you should then be good. Status Code 404 (DEPRECATED) # Failed with status code 404 @line 890 (asyncCommandHandler) The Heroku service will put an app to sleep once it detects no activity for 30 minutes. The Echo Speaks system has a \"Heart Beat\" that talks to Heroku to keep the app awake. We are dealing with the cloud here, so sometimes there may be a delay in the Heart Beat, resulting in a nap for your server. Steps to Fix # Step 1: # To remedy this it is helpful to open the Web Config page. Which normally wakes the service up. Sometimes this may take a couple of minutes. Step 2: # You can easily navigate to this page by following these steps. We recommend that you create a link to the page in case of any future incidents, then it will be a simple one click fix. Step 3: # Log into the Heroku.com website and click on your app. Then click on Settings and scroll down to the Domains and Certificates section (pictured below). Step 4: # Click on the link listed next to Domain . This will take you to the Amazon Cookie Retrieval page which looks similar to the picture below. If it shows 'Authentication Good` then you should then be good to go. If you are directed to log in again, then just do it and you should then be good. /ap/cvf Request Error # If you see this error when you are attempting to do the Amazon Login part of the server deployment, We have found this to be due to having had the Amazon 2FA (2 Step Verfication) service activated, and then later turned off. Unfortunately, once you have had this service turned on, it will have to be on for Echo Speaks to work properly. You may or may not remember ever having it turned on in the past, but with the presence of this error, it is very possible. To remedy this error you will need to turn the 2FA service back on and redeploy the server.
